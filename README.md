# PHP-Website---Text-Based-MMO

Can be found at: http://mi-linux.wlv.ac.uk/~1610476/index.php/welcome/home

This is a text-based MMO, such as Torn City, that utilises AJAX and new HTML5 features such as drag and drop and built in security. 

Technical specifications:
PHP
Code Igniter with the MVC design pattern.
AJAX, JQuery, HTML5, BootStrap (Although I did not make use of mobile first), and other web technologies. 
PhpMyAdmin MySQL Database back end. 
Hosted on a university linux server.
Paypal API added. 
Drag and drop. 

Self criticism: 
I only made use of 1 single model and 1 controller. Although this of course works, it is ugly to look at. Especially my model. 
If I was an employee I would have divided my controllers and models up into managable pieces. 

Open to SQL attacks since I used pure SQL queries opposed to the built in code igniter functions.

Overall it took roughly one week for me to do the bulk of the coding for this website as it was a learning experience as well as part of my web moduel assessment (which I got 50/50 marks on).
